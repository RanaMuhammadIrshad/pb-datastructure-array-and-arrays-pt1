# Arrays: Introduction

**Instructions**
1. Declare a variable named `myArray` and store an array that contains 5 elements. Print the array.

2. Access the 3rd element in the array and save that to another variable named `thirdElement`. Print the `thirdElement`. 

3. Reassign the fourth element of the array and give it a value of "fourth element". Print the array once more. 
 

# Programming Basics: Arrays and Array Methods
These exercises are designed for practicing arrays and array methods. **You may need to look up some methods to complete these tasks.** Print each result to the console.

**work in solution.js**

1. Declare a variable named `euroCities` and assign an array of 5 european cities to the variable e.g. `["Paris", "London", "Valletta", "Prague", "Rome"]`. Declare another variable `secondCity` and assign the second item of the array as a value.

2. Change the first item in the array to "Berlin".

3. Print the length of the array `euroCities`.

4. Remove the last item of the array `euroCities`. 

5. Use an array method to add "Budapest" to the end of the `euroCities` array. 

6. Create another variable named `asianCities` and assign an array of at least 5 cities to the variable.

7. Use a method to combine `euroCities` and `asianCities` into one array. Store the result in a variable `worldCities`.  

8. Reverse the order of `worldCities`.

9. **Bonus**: Remove the third item from the `euroCities` array. 

10. **Bonus**: Use an array method to select items 2 to 4 from the array of `asianCities` and store this in another variable.  

11. **Bonus**: Replace the 3rd item in the array of `worldCities` with "Toronto". 

12. **Bonus**: Remove no elements from the array of `worldCities`, but insert "Washington" at the 2nd position.

13. **Bonus** Write a program to join all elements of the result (`worldCities) into a string. 

Example: `worldCities = ["Berlin", "London", "Bangkok", "Phnom Penh"]`;

Expected Outputs: 

"Berlin , London, Bangkok, Phnom Penh"

"Berlin+London+Bangkok+Phnom Penh" 

**Bonus**

1. Write a program to reverse the string: "Hello World". 

**Extra Practice**

Print the results to the console.

1. Make an array of your siblings' names or your favorite movie characters' names.
2. Make an array of your parents' names.
3. Combine these two arrays.
4. Add your pets' names.
5. Reverse the order of the array.
6. Access one of your parents' names.
7. Update the name of one of your parents.
